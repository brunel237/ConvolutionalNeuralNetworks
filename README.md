- Here we aim to recognize cats from dogs with help of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- Take note : a 'DataSet' directory, containing a 'training_set' directory and a 'test_set' directory, should be added on the master branch.
- These sub directories (training_set and test_set) should both have the 'dogs' directory and 'cats' directory each.
- Then populate all these sub directories with cats and dogs images respectively, for training set and test set accordingly.
- The more images you use to train and test, the best the precision of results the program will have. I used >33000 images!!!
- Make sure to verify directory paths in the program to match the aimed path. Paths are writen in Linux manner.
- This project is free and open source. You are free to do whatever you want with it.
- The program 'using libraries' uses predefined python libraries for machine learning like Keras
- The program 'without libraries' contains a code of the whole machine learning process writen from scatch with python, yes! even basic libraries like numpy.
- For any suggestions or help, contact or email me : bruneltsafack@gmail.com
- Good luck..
